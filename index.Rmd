## Filtering columns and rows

With SQL, you can filter columns and rows by using Select and where. Let's look at an example using Lahman database.

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)

library(sqldf)
```


Supose now  I would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. I could write the following query:

```{r}
query <-"select playerID,yearID,teamID,hr from Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```
